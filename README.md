<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About the assignment
Education is a big part of our mission here at Maybe. For this coding challenge, you'll be building a set of tips to try and make our users a bit more on top of things financially with an accordion/collapsible content component to show these tips without being overwhelming at first glance. The data is coming from the back-end (it's ready for you to fetch!)


### Made with
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)


### Installation and start
To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/francoromanol/finance-frontend.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. 
    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

Once started, the app should be available via [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Deliverables
1. **What are some edge-cases you'd consider before shipping this feature?:**
  Before shipping, I would consider common Accessibility issues like Semantic structure – for proper readability to screen readers – and Keyboard accesibility. I would also check the responsive edge cases, e.g the icons or title gets to big to the container.
&nbsp;  
2. **Which of your skills that you expect to use in this role do you feel weren't highlighted in this project?:**
  I love working on the detail so I probably would have worked a bit more on animations or color changes. I would also have worked more time on the responsive.
&nbsp;
3. **What's important for remote engineering teams to work well?:**
  I think the important thing in an asynchronous company is organization and communication. Write and communicate correctly, as if we were writing technical documentation about a project or a blog post to understand each other, that is, to be concise, direct and very visual.
  Maybe this last point has a lot to do with my other career (architecture and design), but I think the visual is a key point of asynchronous communication.

#### Thank you for your time!
Hello! I hope these notes are useful for you to read the exercise. If there is something that is not very clear, ask me and I will try to clarify it. I would love to receive your feedback!
